  <div class="entry-content"><p>We allow all our UK based developers to have some time to explore new technologies, try out prototypes and clean-up things that escape the day to day process. 2 days out 10, seems a lot doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<h2>How we started</h2>

<p>We started doing our 20% time when we had 2 week sprints with a release each sprint. We actually had 3 days of testing, small bug fixing and signing things off. We didn&#8217;t like starting our new stories for the next sprint as our QAs got behind and never really caught up. We decided to use this time more for clean-up but also for prototyping or trying something out. We had read of other companies doing something similar so were excited to try it out.</p>

<p>One of the first times we did this we actually decided we wanted to automate all the testing of one of our systems, so that our QAs weren&#8217;t bogged down for those 3 days. In our first 20% time, we got most of the team on board as it was painful watching, let alone doing manual testing and we wanted faster feedback on our changes. We got a lot of the system in a state we could test it. We basically wrote a lot of a page object model and a few features to talk to it. The next 30% time it needed cleaning up, the next we had a lot under test. With a bit of work the 3 day test cycle was down to about 1 day. This would never have happened if we were trying in normal sprint time. Major win number 1 and something no business owner had had to wrestle against other priorities.</p>

<p>After this instance we have had numerous similar examples, albeit on a smaller scale, where each team has been able to try things out, with no consequence in the event of failure, and achieved great prototypes. Much of our new architecture has been tested out in these sessions, new technologies, new approaches, can people work together?</p>

<h2>Failures, not so bad after all</h2>

<p>Of course, we have had many failures, but maybe even that helps, we wont waste our proper sprint time. Some people ask me about rules when I talk about this. I think the key for me is that the engineers are truly given freedom to explore. If on the face of things something they are doing is completely away from what you are doing then it might seem a bit strange. But what if they are looking to try something new and would have left your company to do so, what if they think it might be a solution but don&#8217;t know how to say, what if they can use it in 9 months on an urgent project. All these things can and have happened.</p>

<h2>Fear, as always, is detrimental</h2>

<p>Another rule, no fear, this applies in many situations of course. But unlike hackathons where you feel the need to present at the end, presenting should be through excitement of the creator, not demand of the manager.</p>

<h2>Better team as a result</h2>

<p>I have found our whole engineering group has got a lot stronger through the time we have been doing 20% time, also we have been more attractive in interviews due to us having 20% time. So many developers just want an opportunity to learn and will leave a job to do so.</p>

<p>I now have a child, trying to try new skills and do experiments at home is proving harder and harder. This 20% time becomes more important, as a team we are trying to really get to grips with the latest trends in the development community, I just don&#8217;t have anywhere near as much time in the evenings now, it is a way to stop a divide coming between your team, the ones with spare time and the ones without.</p>

<p>I recommend giving it some serious thought for your organisation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever been lucky enough to mentor someone who really got it? Maybe you&#8217;ve had the opposite experience and the session ended up being a failure for both of you?</p>

<p>We are fortunate enough to be in an industry that gives us the chance to coach others and have a direct influence on the learning of individuals around us. But how do we know when we&#8217;re doing it right, or more importantly what can we do when it starts to go wrong?</p>

<h2>Know your student, find their style</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with the science behind how we learn.</p>

<p>The first recognised attempt to identify different approaches individuals use in order to learn was David Kolb with the book &#8217;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Experiential-Learning-Experience-Source-Development/dp/0132952610">Experimental Learning</a>&#8217;. Kolb suggested that humans have a range of learning techniques available to us and that we tend to lean on one learning style above all others.</p>

<p>In recent times his research has proved to be inaccurate - yes people have different learning styles, yes they  show an emphasis in one particular style but Kolb&#8217;s definition of separate styles was confused.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Peter_Honey_and_Alan_Mumford.27s_model">Honey and Mumford and their 1999 adaptation on Kolb&#8217;s model</a>. They identified four distinct learning styles which have since grown to be the preferred assessment of human learning styles.</p>

<table style="font-size: 80%;margin-bottom:20px;">

        <th style="padding:3px;"></th>
        <th style="padding:3px;"><b>Description</b></th>

    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;"><b>Activists</b></td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Enjoy doing, tend to act first and think later. They like working with others but often hog the limelight.</td>

        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Observing individuals or teams at work,  reviewing what has happened and what they have learned from it.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Acting as a leader in front of others, doing things without preparation, being rushed by deadlines.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr style="background-color: #E5E5E5">
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;"><b>Theorists</b></td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Able to adapt and integrate observations into complex theories. Tend to be perfectionists. Detached and analytical rather than emotive.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">When put into complex and structured situations having to apply their skill and knowledge. Have the chance to question and probe ideas.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">With unstructured or poorly briefed activities. Will struggle in situations where emphasise is put on emotion or feelings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;"><b>Pragmatists</b></td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Practical and down to earth. Keen to try things out they can be impatient especially with long discussions.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Respond well to demonstrations of techniques that show an obvious advantage.</td>
        <td style="padding:3px;vertical-align:top;">Learning is all theory. No guidelines on how to accomplish activity. No apparent pay back.</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>The important thing to remember is not all individuals can be pigeon-holed into one group. These characteristics are evident across all industries and teams; I can certainly see myself and others in this list. Can you?</p>

<p>Now we can silo and identify behaviour, we can look deeper into the flow of learning.</p>

<h2>Complete the circle</h2>

<p>Let me introduce you to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/bernice-mccarthy/15/564/715">Bernice McCarthy</a>. Bernice has been in education for more than 30 years so it&#8217;s not surprising she has an insight into her field. During her time in education she spotted a pattern and designed a framework that increased the success rate of individual learning.</p>

<p>Research suggests that this framework (<a href="http://www.4mat.eu/">4MAT</a>) is proven to be successful as it follows the thought processes of individuals when they try to learn. It works by explaining not just the WHY? but also the WHAT?, the HOW? and the WHAT IF?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.chowamigo.co.uk/images/4mat.png" alt="image" /></p>

<ol>
<li><p>WHY? => Convey the meaning and purpose of the change in order to engage people. <strong>Engage the why</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>WHAT? => Once it&#8217;s made relevant provide facts, structure or theory to explain what is going to happen. <strong>Inform the what</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>HOW? => Focus on the problems and how best to solve them. <strong>Applying the how</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>WHAT IF? => Ask questions and experiment. What else, what&#8217;s next. <strong>Learn by doing</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>So how is this helpful?</p>

<p>If we look at the the 4MAT framework and overlay the 4 learning styles from Honey and Mumford we can see some obvious similarites:</p>

<p>PRAGMATISTS = WHY?</p>

<p>ACTIVISTS = WHAT?</p>

<p>THEORISTS = HOW?</p>

<p>ACTIVISTS = WHAT IF?</p>

<p>This is really useful to know, by following the 4MAT framework you are reaching out to each learning style and increasing your chances of being successful in your role as a coach, mentor or teacher.</p>

<h2>Theory schmery, how does this work in practice?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s easy enough for us to read this information and take it in, forget about it, move on.</p>

<p>But if we look at a real-world scenario, something that is relevant to our industry and is generally a tough problem to sell it&#8217;ll make it more tangible. In my world, that can be breaking apart a legacy application that has become too difficult to work with.</p>

<p><strong>WHY?</strong>
We have a monolithic website right now. The code is too complicated, has no obvious structure and is very tough to change. We need to be able to release solid code, fast.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT?</strong>
The fact is we are struggling to maintain this application and we can forget about adding new features. Even small updates are causing outages. As a result our site performance has degraded to unacceptable levels.</p>

<p><strong>HOW?</strong>
The initial thought from the team is to break the monolith into identifiable pieces of functionality. We will try to get each piece behind an API. We hope to abstract the front-end code away so it communicates to these new endpoints.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IF?</strong>
What if we refactor with the MVP pattern first and see where the duplication lies? Is there an argument to leave the non-urgent areas of the site until the appetite is there to attack them? We think REST APIs are the way to go, what are your thoughts?</p>

<h2>Do, there is no try</h2>

<p>Outlining and truly grasping these styles can really help push learning in your team further. Try reaching out to different learning styles and see how people respond.</p>

<p>Maybe you are pairing on a tricky feature, struggling to get your point across. Perhaps you have a tough decision that you need to sell to your team. Let&#8217;s say you are lucky enough to speak at a conference in front of hundreds of delegates - you could do a lot worse than to remember <strong>WHY?</strong>   <strong>WHAT?</strong> <strong>HOW? </strong> <strong>WHAT IF?</strong></p>

<time datetime="2013-11-22T09:34:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 22<span>nd</span>, 2013</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_pug_me.png"></p>

<p>As a part of our 30% time a few of our team, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajroyle">@ajroyle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stack72">@stack72</a> and I (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryantomlinson">@ryantomlinson</a>) decided to get together and look at <a href="http://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a> with <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/">Hipchat</a> integration. There are several weird and wonderful scripts that ship with Hubot (see above) but the core concept of driving tooling via chat is one that we see value in.</p>

<h2>What is Chatops?</h2>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github">Chatops</a> is a term coined by Github to describe their growing culture of “putting tools in the middle of the conversation”. But what does that exactly mean?</p>

<p>To move fast and maintain stability it’s important to have a culture of automation, measurement and sharing (<a href="http://www.opscode.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/">CAMS</a>). Tooling plays a key role in doing so and as your devops toolkit grows with the team there is an inherent learning and maintenance overhead. <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> made a move to centralise the conversation by driving everything they do into chat. By building tools and executing commands in a chat room that can be automated by a bot, communication doesn’t become an afterthought to operational processes but is core to how you operate. If I want to deploy code, I type a command into chat. If I want to take a server offline, I type a command into chat. If I want to merge a git pull request into master, I type in a command into chat, and so on. Communication is baked in.</p>

<h2>What is Hubot?</h2>

<p>Hubot is a chat bot that sits in your chat room, listens for commands and executes them. It was written by Github in Coffeescript on Node.js and comes with a host of <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts">prewritten scripts</a> to get started with. Hubot also comes with a range of adaptors that allow it to plug-in to chat servers such as Campfire, IRC and Hipchat. We chose the latter.</p>

<h2>How do you get started?</h2>

<p>I won’t re-write the readme because the getting started section <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/tree/master/docs">here</a> says it all. Using the node package manager it’s so easy to get up and running with <a href="https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot">Hubot</a>. So many other people have documented this process that I won’t attempt to rewrite their <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/writing-hubot-plugins-with-coffeescript/">good</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot">posts</a>.</p>

<h2>How we want to use it and our first scripts</h2>

<p>Although the core scripts that shipped with Hubot are helpful…</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_beer_me.png"></p>

<p>…we started to focus on commands that would be most useful to how we work at <a href="http://www.toptable.co.uk/">toptable</a> and the tools and technologies that we employ. Specifically we got together and decided the following would be a useful starting point:</p>

<ul>
<li>Triggering TeamCity builds to ship to production</li>
<li>Displaying the status of a JIRA ticket, adding comments and changing their status</li>
<li>Checking London Underground tube lines for delays via Transport for London API</li>
<li>Querying the status of our APIs (internal and external)</li>
<li>Query ElasticSearch node and health cluster</li>
</ul>


<p>Within no time we had some useful scripts written:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_tube_status.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_jira.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/hubot_teamcity.png"></p>

<p>Immediately as we were developing these scripts we realised the potential of what else we could automate into Hubot and we will continue to do so. Some of which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Github interaction</li>
<li>AWS interaction to see host health</li>
<li>Teamcity integration to trigger builds</li>
<li>Nagios interaction to trigger status checks</li>
<li>More JIRA integration to comment on tickets</li>
<li>Kibana integration to create dashboard URLs</li>
<li>AppDynamics interaction to query response times etc. (and more)</li>
</ul>


<p>Driving operations in chat has huge benefits for us. Collaboration, deployment and automation of common tasks can be done from anywhere, in the office (UK or US) or remotely for those that work from home. Hipchat has mobile support and their mobile apps are great. We hope it will improve on-call visibility, triaging of issues and resolving them without the need for VPN.</p>

&lt;meta name="msApplication-PackageFamilyName" content="OpenTable.OpenTable_r44en0zefym0a"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/get-app-for-this-site.png"></p>

<p>This will enable the <strong>&#8220;Get app for this site&#8221;</strong> link when you are viewing your page in the full-screen Metro version of Internet Explorer (i.e. launched from the start screen); the desktop version of IE doesn&#8217;t have this capability.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh781489%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#code-snippet-1">three other optional meta values</a> that can also be used to control your link.</p>

<h2>Finding the values</h2>

<p>There are at least two ways of finding the values. If you have your application code and Visual Studio 2012 (or later) then the values can be found in the <strong>package.appxmanifest</strong> file &ndash; open this in VS and it automatically launches the manifest designer view.  Select the Packaging tab and the &#8220;Package name&#8221; is the <em>ID</em>, and the <em>Package family name</em> is at the bottom of this screen.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/vs-screenshot.png"></p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have the local code with Visual Studio you can still find out these values by other means.</p>

<p>The <strong>msApplication-PackageFamilyName</strong> can be found in the source code of your online Windows 8 app.  For example, <a href="view-source:http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/d7c37fb3-d594-4366-8003-e49c8e953095">viewing the source of the OpenTable app</a> shows a Javascript variable <code>packageFamilyName</code> embedded in the page head.</p>

<pre><code>var packageFamilyName = 'OpenTable.OpenTable_r44en0zefym0a';
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>msApplication-ID</strong> is still found in the <code>package.appxmanifest</code> file in your Win8 app, but you don&#8217;t necessarily need to have the local code or Visual Studio.  We were able to access package.appxmanifest in our GitHub repo (it&#8217;s an XML file) and the msApplication-ID was the same as the <strong>identity name</strong>.  I don&#8217;t know if the Application ID and the identity name are always the same, but they were for us.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Identity Name="OpenTable.OpenTable" Publisher="CN=9C8CE42A-5BD4-4679" Version="1.0.0.1910" /&gt; 
</code></pre>

<h2>Gotchas</h2>

<p>We tried opening the site in Visual Studio 2012 in Windows 7, but the project containing package.appxmanifest wouldn&#8217;t open.  We had to open the solution in Windows 8, which finally worked once we&#8217;d logged into MSDN and installed the suggested updates.</p>

<p>Also, the content values of the meta data are not case sensitive, but the names msApplication-ID and msApplication-PackageFamilyName are.</p>

<p>Finally, having entered what we knew to be the correct values, clicking the &#8220;Get app for this site&#8221; link still wouldn&#8217;t take us to <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/d7c37fb3-d594-4366-8003-e49c8e953095">the OpenTable app in the Windows store</a>.  After checking with an American colleague the penny dropped that the OpenTable app is only available in the US and Microsoft have unfortunately not provided any visual feedback to explain this.</p>

<p>Luckily instead of just having to take his word that the new code worked there is a way to change your Windows Store settings and fake your location.  <a href="http://www.guidingtech.com/20936/change-windows-8-store-region/">Have a look at this helpful article</a> and you&#8217;re all set to have your website and Windows app happily talking to each other.</p>

<time datetime="2013-09-25T19:28:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 25<span>th</span>, 2013</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When building a previous project, I created an ASP.NET MVC application that would allow subdomains to resolve to different areas of the project and thus show different views. I wanted to be able to extend this functionality. I wanted to allow different domains to point to different areas. This would allow me to deploy the application just once and then have different headers on the web server rather than regional variances. Whilst on a flight to San Francisco, I was able to hack together some code that allows just that. The details of that hackiness are below.</p>

<p>I started with a simple ASP.NET MVC application. I then created an area. The default area registration looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public class Domain1AreaRegistration: AreaRegistration   
{
    public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
    {
        context.MapRoute(
            "Domain_1_default",
            "Domain1/{controller}/{action}/{id}",
            new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional },
            new[] { "WebApplication.Controllers" }
        );
    }

    public override string AreaName
    {
        get { return "Domain1"; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The name of the folder in my project corresponds to the AreaName as above. I have approximately six areas in the application that relate to different views. Now is where the hacky magic happens. I build the routing for the application myself. In my global.asax.cs, I have the following declaration:</p>

<pre><code>protected void Application_Start()
{
    AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();

    //this is done using my IoC container
    var routingEngine = new RoutingEngineFactory();
    routingEngine.RoutingRegistration(RouteTable.Routes);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the creation of my RoutingEngine. This class is responsible for taking each area in the system in turn and then creating the routes for my application based on these. I am sure you are asking why I am doing that? The answer is simply that I can use a combination of MapRoute and IRouteConstraints to build a sufficient route for the URLs I need to map. The code looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public void RoutingRegistration(RouteCollection routes)
{
    var areaNames = GetAllAreasRegistered(routes);
    routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");
    routes.IgnoreRoute("{*favicon}", new { favicon = @"(.*/)?favicon.ico(/.*)?" });

    foreach (var area in areaNames.Select(Area.From))
    {
        RegisterDefaultRoute(area.Name, routes);
    }
}

private void RegisterDefaultRoute(string areaName, RouteCollection routes)
{
    var defaultRoute = routes.MapRoute(
            BuildRouteSegment(areaName, "Default"),
            "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
            new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional },
            BuildUrlConstraint(areaName),
            new[] { DefaultControllerNameSpace }
            );
    defaultRoute.SetAreaDataTokens(areaName);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code works in the following way:</p>

<p>Get a list of all the areas.
Add the Ignore routes as these are more specific and need to be at the top of the list.
To this list of areas, add a new area of name string.Empty. This will allow us to register the routes for the non area parts of the site. This is really hacky as denoted by the code above.
Foreach area in the list, register a route. This route has the same URL for all routes.
But how do we distinguish which of the routes match to a specific domain?</p>

<p>routes.MapRoute in MVC has a number of overloads. The overload we will be using has the following signature:</p>

<p>public static Route MapRoute(this RouteCollection routes, string name, string url, object defaults, object constraints, string[] namespaces)
Notice that is has a parameter for constraints. All I need to do is to build the correct constraint and I will be able to give my system a way to match a specific domain. There is another overload that has no parameter for constraints and that passes null down the stack - so I can pass a null constraint for the non areas based part of the site. There is only a need to pass a constraint to the route if there is an area specified. The code to create the correct constraint looks as following:</p>

<pre><code>private static object BuildUrlConstraint(string areaName)
{
    object constraint = null;
    if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(areaName))
    {
        var constraintType = new DomainConstraintFactory(areaName).GetConstraint();
        constraint = new {controller = constraintType};
    }
    return constraint;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The domain constraint factory does all the work for me here. It can be as simple or as complex as you need it to be. Here is a snippet of code to show you:</p>

<pre><code>public class DomainConstraintFactory
{
    private readonly string _areaName;
    public DomainConstraintFactory(string areaName)
    {
        _areaName = areaName;
    }

    public IRouteConstraint GetConstraint()
    {
        switch (_areaName.ToLower())
        {
            case "domain1":
                return new Domain1Constraint();
            case "domain2":
                return new Domain2Constraint();
        }
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The correct constraint will now be able to be passed to the route. The constraints are very simple:</p>

<pre><code>public class Domain1Constraint : IRouteConstraint
{
    public bool Match(HttpContextBase httpContext, Route route, string parameterName, RouteValueDictionary values, RouteDirection routeDirection)
    {
        if (httpContext != null &amp;&amp; httpContext.Request != null &amp;&amp; httpContext.Request.Url != null)
        {
            if (httpContext.Request.Url.Host == "www.mydomain.com")
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we register Domain1 and Domain2 areas with the system, MVC will take each route in turn and test the constraint. It will return the Area to show based on the first match on the system.</p>

<p>I can now pass in www.mydomain1.com and show the specific styling of the views in the Domain1 areas folder. By passing www.mydomain2.com, I can show a completely different set of views and let the user believe that they are on a completely different version of the site.</p>

<p>The code needs to be cleaned up a lot. I will be doing this over the coming weeks. I wouldn’t quite class this as the best practice way of doing this, but it certainly shows that there is no need to have different versions of a website deployed just to show a different version of an application on a different URL. The biggest usecase here for me is deploying the same application to different countries without the need for separate deployments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Someone in the office mentioned <a href="http://www.rethinkdb.com">RethinkDb</a> and I was impressed by the rhetoric on the site, so I decided to spend a couple of hours spiking one of our existing nodejs apps with RethinkDb. The app currently uses MongoDb so inevitably I&#8217;m comparing the two.</p>

<h1>Things I liked:</h1>

<p><strong>Nodejs Driver</strong></p>

<p>The api on the nodejs driver is pretty nice, it makes a concerted effort to reduce &#8220;pyramid code&#8221; by allowing you to build your query by method-chaining and then call a <code>.run()</code> extension to execute the query.</p>

<p><strong>Interface</strong>
The management interface is very good, incredibly friendly, and has guided access to things like sharding and replication settings (as well as the usual array of other things to tinker with).</p>

<p><strong>Sharding, Replication and Clustering</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s all there, up front in the web UI, written in plain English and with friendly guides to help. The health and performance monitoring is available up-front in clear and concise graphics.</p>

<p><strong>Writes are non-locking operations</strong></p>

<p>A major bugbear for us with mongoDb is that writes require a database-level lock. RethinkDb allows block-level locks for write operations, and furthermore, reads can still proceed while write locks are in effect. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control">MVCC ftw!</a></p>

<h1>Things I didn&#8217;t like:</h1>

<p><strong>Cannot query on unindexed fields</strong></p>

<p>Meaning ad-hoc queries can be a pain-in-the-arse, especially if you have a large data set.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<p>RethinkDb readily admit that their current release (v1.9.0) has taken a performance hit after implementing their clustering layer. They are hopeful that they can bring the performance back in the next few versions. My very simple, somewhat unscientific testing found it to be about 5 times slower than mongo, for a simple document read (20ms vs 120ms).</p>

<p><strong>Joins</strong></p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s a nice feature, it just makes me feel dirty to do joins on a document database.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>RethinkDb is a good looking database. It&#8217;s feature-full and dead simple to use. Would I use it in production? Not yet. The performance issues are still a sticking point for me, but I have no doubt that once these are fixed RethinkDb will be a big contender.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Counting is the religion of this generation it is its hope and its salvation.
Gertrude Stein</p></blockquote>

<p>In our NeverEnding quest to provide better experience to the users we utilise user behaviour logs to influence future results. One particular case is restaurant popularity, which is indicated by many factors, for example how often it is searched and viewed.</p>

<p>In this blog post we will look into multiple ways of counting documents in Elastic Search which is crucial for this kind of activity. All examples here are provided using Elastic Search HTTP interface and code examples implemented with <a href="https://github.com/Yegoroff/PlainElastic.Net">PlainElastic.NET</a> are <a href="https://gist.github.com/gondar/6320578">available here</a></p>

<p>Before we make a deep dive into Elastic Search Counting options let&#8217;s define our expectations:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>So that I can order restaurants by those that are most searched
</span><span class='line'>As a potential diner
</span><span class='line'>I want the most searched statistics from the logs to be part of the search database</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Okay, that&#8217;s not exactly how our story was defined but as we don&#8217;t want to discuss the whole search infrastructure here, let&#8217;s assume this is sufficient.</p>

<p>Because we are eager engineers, we will quickly build some mock data against which to test our assumptions. Our restaurant name search logs look something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  "RestaurantId" : 2,
</span><span class='line'>  "RestaurantName" : "Restaurant Brian",
</span><span class='line'>  "DateTime" : "2013-08-16T15:13:47.4833748+01:00"
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So we will populate our mock database with appropriate commands and check that all is in place:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl http://localhost:9200/store/item/ -XPOST -d '{"RestaurantId":2,"RestaurantName":"Restaurant Brian","DateTime":"2013-08-16T15:13:47.4833748+01:00"}'
</span><span class='line'>curl http://localhost:9200/store/item/ -XPOST -d '{"RestaurantId":1,"RestaurantName":"Restaurant Cecil","DateTime":"2013-08-16T15:13:47.4833748+01:00"}'
</span><span class='line'>curl http://localhost:9200/store/item/ -XPOST -d '{"RestaurantId":1,"RestaurantName":"Restaurant Cecil","DateTime":"2013-08-16T15:13:47.4833748+01:00"}'
</span><span class='line'>curl http://localhost:9200/store/item/_search?q=*\&pretty</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Our expected output is a count of documents for each restaurant. For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  "Restaurant Brian" : 1
</span><span class='line'>  "Restaurant Cecil" : 2
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are three ways this can be achieved in Elastic Search; using count API (which seems like the most obvious way), a search with type set to count, or using facets to generate counts of all objects grouped by given property. Let&#8217;s compare them:</p>

<h3>Count API</h3>

<p>(<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/count/">See documentation here</a>)</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/store/item/_count -d '{
</span><span class='line'>  "field": {
</span><span class='line'>      "RestaurantName": {
</span><span class='line'>          "query": "Restaurant Cecil",
</span><span class='line'>          "default_operator": "AND"
</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>}'
</span><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  "count":2,
</span><span class='line'>  "_shards":{"total":5,"successful":5,"failed":0}
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Count is nice little feature which solves our problem. However, if we need count for multiple restaurants we need to execute similar queries multiple times, which may hugely influence both performance of our query and usage of our ElasticSeach cluster.</p>

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>(<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/search-type/">See documentation here</a>)</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/store/item/_search?search_type=count -d ' {
</span><span class='line'>  "query": {
</span><span class='line'>      "field": {
</span><span class='line'>          "RestaurantName": {
</span><span class='line'>              "query": "Restaurant Cecil",
</span><span class='line'>              "default_operator": "AND"
</span><span class='line'>          }
</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>}'
</span><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  "took":5,"timed_out":false,"_shards":{"total":5,"successful":5,"failed":0},
</span><span class='line'>  "hits": {
</span><span class='line'>      "total": 2,
</span><span class='line'>      "max_score": 0.0,
</span><span class='line'>      "hits":[]
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Using search type set to count is the same as executing a search request with size set to zero, but it&#8217;s internally optimised for performance. The nice thing about search is that we can use multi_search interface to execute many count queries at once.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the query still will be executed multiple times, so it is only feasible if we want to get popularity for a small subset of all the restaurants we have.</p>

<p>Comparing two previous requests highlights that the query language is slightly different. The DSL for <em>count API</em> is basically the same as for the <em>search API</em>, but you are immediately inside the &#8216;query&#8217; part. That inconsistency on the ElasticSearch side is only a minor inconvenience.</p>

<h3>Facets</h3>

<p>(<a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/reference/api/search/facets/">See documentation here</a>)</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<p>Facets is a means to obtain grouping by a given field together with count in a group. It is designed to ease creation of filters which are often naturally part of search results interface.</p>

<p>This is nice feature which grabs for us all counts grouped by given field. That&#8217;s more then we need if we only care for a count of single type, but it&#8217;s invaluable if you want to have counts for all terms in a field. Also note that we are using search type count again, but facets work equally well for all types of searches including those which actually return results.</p>

<p>In the example above we used &#8216;RestaurantId&#8217; field instead of restaurant name, as this field is not analysed. If we used restaurant name it would give us facets for each term e.g. [{&#8220;term&#8221;: &#8220;Restaurant&#8221;, &#8220;count&#8221;: 3}, {&#8220;term&#8221;:&#8221;Cecil&#8221;, &#8220;count&#8221;:2},{&#8220;term&#8221;:&#8221;Brian&#8221;, &#8220;count&#8221;:1}], which is not what we exactly want.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to discuss which one is better. Count API is slightly faster then Search of type count. On the other hand search is more flexible, and its queries are consistent with normal search queries. Facets is a different beast altogether as it always grabs all the results. Still, it&#8217;s fun that ElasticSearch is elastic in this aspect giving us variety of approaches.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My continued love affair with Grunt reached a new high the other day, when I combined <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> with my <a href="http://tech.toptable.co.uk/blog/2013/08/08/grunt-your-deployments-too/">Grunt deployment tasks</a> and test runners.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to bang on about how great Vagrant is, because better people than me have already soliloquised at length on that subject. Let&#8217;s just take it as writ that <strong>Vagrant is awesome</strong>.</p>

<p>The objective is simple, we want to have a virtualised environment to run our acceptance tests against, that we can create and provision on demand, to ensure that our acceptance tests only deal with functional-correctness, not data- or environment-correctness.</p>

<p>I created a set of Grunt tasks which were able to do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spin up an provision a Vagrant instance</li>
<li>Deploy the project code</li>
<li>Start the server</li>
<li>Run the acceptance tests</li>
<li>Tear it all down</li>
</ul>


<p>All from a single command: <code>grunt acceptance</code></p>

<p>The price of this magic? About ten lines of Bash script, a six line Vagrantfile and some Grunt glue.</p>

<h2>Diving in</h2>

<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve got Vagrant installed, you can create a Vagrantfile in the root of your project, which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vm.box = "Ubuntu precise 64 VMWare"
    config.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64_vmware.box"
    config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3000, host: 3000
    config.vm.provision :shell, :path =&gt; "setup/bootstrap.sh"
end
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the last line &#8216;config.vm.provision&#8217;, this tells Vagrant that there is a shell script at setup/bootstrap.sh which is going to provision your vm. You can provision the box with Puppet, Chef or a variety of other tools, but for the purposes of this simple testing machine, I&#8217;m happy to use a shell script.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at the bootstrap file:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get update -y -q
apt-get install build-essential mongodb -y -q

cp /vagrant/tests/acceptance-tests/mongodb.conf /etc/mongodb.conf
service mongodb restart

wget --quiet http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.15/node-v0.10.15-linux-x64.tar.gz

tar -zxf node-v0.10.15-linux-x64.tar.gz

mv node-v0.10.15-linux-x64/ /opt/node/
ln -s /opt/node/bin/node /usr/bin/node
ln -s /opt/node/bin/npm /usr/bin/npm
</code></pre>

<p>After booting the VM, Vagrant will run this script, which will can do anything you need it to. All the commands run as root, so there&#8217;s very little restriction as to what you can achieve.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re installing Node.js (downloading the binaries manually because the version of Node in the Ubuntu repository is really old), and MongoDB (which our app depends on).</p>

<p>Note this line: <code>cp /vagrant/tests/acceptance-tests/mongodb.conf /etc/mongodb.conf</code> which installs a custom config for MongoDB.</p>

<p>By default, Vagrant will mount a share in /vagrant to the current directory (i.e. the directory on the host machine from which you executed <code>vagrant up</code>), you can map additional folders by adding <code>config.vm.synced_folder "path/on/host", "/path/on/guest"</code> to your Vagrantfile.</p>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got our Vagrant config sorted, we can hook this into Grunt, using a bit of glue code.</p>

<pre><code>var shell = require('shelljs');

grunt.registerTask('vagrant-up', function(){
    shell.exec('vagrant up');
});

grunt.registerTask('vagrant-destroy', function(){
    shell.exec('vagrant destroy -f');
});
</code></pre>

<p>So now that we&#8217;ve got our machine provisioned and booted, we can use Grunt to <a href="http://tech.toptable.co.uk/blog/2013/08/08/grunt-your-deployments-too/">deploy our code and start our service</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming that we&#8217;ve got all that going on, we can move on to the next step, getting Grunt to deploy the code to the Vagrant box.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;m going to do here is hook the deployment step into the &#8216;vagrant-up&#8217; task.</p>

<pre><code>grunt.registerTask('vagrant-up', function(){
    shell.exec('vagrant up');
    grunt.option('config', 'vagrant');
    grunt.task.run('deploy');
});
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for this is so that <code>grunt vagrant-up</code> will spin me up a provisioned box <em>and</em> install the code.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I set the &#8216;config&#8217; option inside the task, this option is required by the deploy task. I could specify it on the command line, but this is just friendlier and makes for a cleaner syntax of the command.</p>

<p>Now, when we run <code>grunt acceptance</code>, it&#8217;ll do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spin up the Vagrant box</li>
<li>Deploy the code</li>
<li>Tear it down again</li>
</ul>


<p>The only step remaining is to run our acceptance tests. For our app, we&#8217;re using mocha, you can use anything so long as you&#8217;ve got a Grunt task to drop in.</p>

<pre><code>var shell = require('shelljs');

grunt.initConfig({
    ...
    mochaTest: {
        options: {
            reporter: 'spec'
        },
        AcceptanceTests:{
            src: ['tests/acceptance-tests/**/*.js']
        }
    }
});

grunt.registerTask('deploy', [
    'sshexec:stop',
    'sshexec:make-release-dir',
    'sshexec:update-symlinks',
    'sftp:deploy',
    'sshexec:npm-update',
    'sshexec:set-config',
    'sshexec:start'
]);

grunt.registerTask('vagrant-up', function(){
    shell.exec('vagrant up');
    grunt.option('config', 'vagrant');
    grunt.task.run('deploy');
});

grunt.registerTask('vagrant-test', [ 'mochaTest:AcceptanceTests' ]);

grunt.registerTask('vagrant-destroy', function(){
    shell.exec('vagrant destroy -f');
});

grunt.registerTask('acceptance', [
    'vagrant-up',
    'vagrant-test',
    'vagrant-destroy'
]);
</code></pre>

<p>Ta-Da! Wasn&#8217;t that painless?</p>

<p>The key part here is that everything is now in source control. So whenever someone checks out the project, it takes precisely <strong><em>one</em></strong> command to get the project going. No more time wasted configuring your dev machine to be able to run this, or that.</p>

<p>The machine is brand-new every time, with its own spangly MongoDB instance ready for use.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s that I hear you whine? &#8221;<em>My application depends on shared data, I can&#8217;t use an empty database</em>&#8221;. Not true. If you need it, set it up or mock it out. The acceptance tests should set-up and tear-down all their own data, if you rely on shared data sources for acceptance tests then you&#8217;re going to have a painful time. Script it once and it&#8217;ll forever be your friend. It&#8217;s time to enter the dynamic era, no more false failures on your CI build because a shared datasource is missing and/or has been changed.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more you can now run <code>grunt acceptance</code> from anywhere and <strong><em>know</em></strong> that it&#8217;ll be the same. No more environment pains!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> as a build tool for our nodejs apps, and it&#8217;s brilliant. It lints, it configures, it minifies, it tests and it packages.</p>

<p>As we move towards getting our first node app into production, we were looking at ways to deploy it. First we thought of <a href="http://www.capistranorb.com">Capistrano</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Capistrano</em></strong> is a fully featured deployment framework written in ruby and levering rake style tasks. It&#8217;s extremely powerful and very robust, plus there is a <a href="https://github.com/loopj/capistrano-node-deploy">gem for node deployments</a>. Alas, it was not to be. After half a day of tail chasing and hoop jumping, it occurred to me that there must be an easier way. Capistrano was encouraging me to make my project fit their template, rather than allowing me to configure the deployment to match my project. When I dug down into the Capistrano source, I found that it was just using ssh and sftp to run remote commands and copy files. But we can simplify this process.</p>

<p><strong><em>Grunt</em></strong> has been great so far, so I started looking at deploying directly through grunt. We would be deploying to Ubuntu server boxes, so the only tools necessary are ssh and sftp.</p>

<p>There are Grunt modules for nearly <a href="https://npmjs.org/search?q=grunt">everything</a> (linting, minifying, testing, waiting, packaging, shell-exec&#8217;ing, tagging, etc.), and rather predictably, sshing (with sftp).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/andrewrjones/grunt-ssh">Grunt-ssh</a> provides tasks for executing remote ssh commands, and for copying files using ssh. Let&#8217;s dive into some code.</p>

<p><strong><em>SSH commands</em></strong></p>

<p>This is going to go over some old ground (available on the Grunt-ssh <a href="https://github.com/andrewrjones/grunt-ssh">readme</a>), but we can build up the commands pretty quick.</p>

<p>This is the basic config for executing ssh commands from your Gruntfile:</p>

</span><span class='line'>};</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We&#8217;ve registered a command, which we can invoke with:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt sshexec:uptime</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The Grunt-ssh module also provides the ability to specify multiple host configurations (shared between commands), and to select one at runtime:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>        port: 22,
</span><span class='line'>        username: "user", 
</span><span class='line'>        password: "password"
</span><span class='line'>      },
</span><span class='line'>      staging: {

</span><span class='line'>      }    
</span><span class='line'>    },
</span><span class='line'>    sshexec: {
</span><span class='line'>      uptime: {

</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>    }  
</span><span class='line'>});</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So when we invoke the grunt task, we can specify a config:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt sshexec:uptime --config qa</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or we can set it programmatically (inside the Gruntfile)</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt.option('config', 'qa');</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong><em>SFTP Tasks</em></strong></p>

<p>Grunt-ssh allows you to upload files via SFTP:</p>

</span><span class='line'>        options: {
</span><span class='line'>          srcBasePath: "package/",
</span><span class='line'>          createDirectories: true
</span><span class='line'>        }
</span><span class='line'>      }
</span><span class='line'>    }  
</span><span class='line'>});</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are a couple of options here, so let&#8217;s break it down:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>files: {
</span><span class='line'>  "./": "package/**"
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will copy all files from the &#8220;package/&#8221; folder locally. If you want to specify only certain types of files, you can use grunt&#8217;s standard <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/grunt.file#globbing-patterns">file globbing</a>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>srcBasePath: "package/"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Optionally strip off an initial part of the path (without it, files would upload to &#8220;/path/on/server/package/&#8221;).</p>

<p><strong><em>Putting it all together</em></strong>
We&#8217;ve got all the component parts, now lets put it together (plus a few other cool bits).</p>

<p><em>Note: at the time of writing, there is a bug in Grunt-ssh where the sftp task does not use the shared sshconfig, so if you want the fixed code, use <a href="https://github.com/andyroyle/grunt-ssh">my fork</a> (there is a pull request outstanding)</em></p>

<p>This snippet assumes that:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can connect to your deployment server using ssh</li>
<li>You are deploying to /var/www/myapp</li>
<li>You are using <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever">forever</a> to run your app</li>
<li>Your application files are copied to ./package/</li>
</ul>


<p>(but, since we&#8217;re just using bash commands, this is easily configurable)</p>

<p>It should all make sense, the sshexec is just running remote ssh commands (making directories, starting and stopping using forever etc). Let&#8217;s just re-iterate what this is doing:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>sshexec:stop</code>: stops the app (assumes you&#8217;re using forever)</li>
<li><code>sshexec:make-release-dir</code>: this will create the folder /var/www/myapp/releases/[current-date-time]</li>
<li><code>sshexec:update-symlinks</code>: this will create a symlink from /var/www/myapp/current to the release folder we just created (this means that rolling back is just a case of changing the symlink back).</li>
<li><code>sftp:deploy</code>: copy the files into place</li>
<li><code>sshexec:npm-update</code>: installs any missing node modules</li>
<li><code>sshexec:set-config</code>: copy the environment configuration into place</li>
<li><code>sshexec:start</code>: start the application using forever, pointing the logs to /var/www/myapp/current/logs/</li>
</ol>


<p><strong><em>Deploying with one command</em></strong></p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt deploy --config qa</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Also, if you noticed the <em>production</em> config I specified in that snippet, you&#8217;ll see that I didn&#8217;t include any host, username or password configs. The <code>grunt.option('value')</code> allows us to access the command line switches, which means we don&#8217;t have to keep any sensitive passwords in source control; we can specify them on the command line.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt deploy --config production --server my.production.server --username user --password password</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are lots of other solutions to the problem of credentials, but this is by far the simplest. It&#8217;s worth remembering the Grunt-ssh uses the ssh2 module, so by default it will look to <code>~/.ssh/</code> for keys when connecting without a password.</p>

<p><strong>But wait, there&#8217;s more</strong></p>

<p>Basically any task you can think of is scriptable using grunt (and some combination of tools). Extra things that we&#8217;ve added to our deployment process include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removing the application server from the load-balancer before deploying (and pushing it back when the deployment is complete).</li>
<li>Making a http request to check the health of the service before going live.</li>
<li>Rollback from a single command</li>
</ul>
