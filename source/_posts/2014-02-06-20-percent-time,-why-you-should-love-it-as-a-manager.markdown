We allow all our UK based developers to have some time to explore new technologies, try out prototypes and clean-up things that escape the day to day process. 2 days out 10, 2 every week, seems a lot doesn't it?

How we started
--------------
We started doing our 20% time when we had 2 week sprints with a release each sprint. We actually had 3 days of testing, small bug fixing and signing things off. We didn't like starting our new stories for the next sprint as our QAs got behind and never really caught up. We decided to use this time more for clean-up but also for prototyping or trying something out. We had read of other companies doing something similar so were excited to try it out. 

One of the first times we did this we actually decided we wanted to automate all the testing of one of our systems, so that our QAs weren't bogged down for 3 days. In 3 days, we got most of the team on board as it was painful watching let alone doing manual testing and we wanted faster feedback on our changes, we got a lot of the system in a state we could test it. We basically wrote a lot of a page object model and a few features to talk to it. The next 30% time it needed cleaning up, the next we had a lot under test. With a bit of work the 3 day test cycle was down to about 1 day. This would never have happened if we were trying in normal sprint time. Major win number 1.

After this instance we have had numerous similar examples, albeit on a smaller scale, where each team has been able to try things out, with no consequence in the event of failure, and achieved great prototypes. Much of our new architecture has been tested out in these sessions, new technologies, new approaches, can people work together.

Failures, not so bad after all
------------------------------
Of course, we have had many failures, but maybe even that helps, we wont waste our proper sprint time. Some people ask me about rules when I talk about this. I think the key for me is that the engineers are truly given freedom to explore. If on the face of things something they are doing is completely away from what you are doing then it might seem a bit strange. But what if they are looking to try something new and would have left your company to do so, what if they think it might be a solution but don't know how to say, what if they can use it in 9 months on an urgent project. All these things can and have happened.

Fear, as always, is detrimental
-------------------------------
Another rule, no fear, this applies in many situations of course. But unlike hackathons where you feel the need to present at the end, presenting should be through excitement of the creator, not demand of the manager.

Better team as a result
-----------------------
I have found our whole engineering group has got a lot stronger through the time we have been doing 20% time, also we have been more attractive in interviews due to us having 20% time.

I now have a child, trying to do new skills at home is proving harder and harder. This time becomes more important, we are trying to really get to grips with the latest trends in the development community, I just don't have anywhere near as much time in the evenings now, it is a way to stop a divide coming between your team.

I recommend giving it some serious thought for your organisation.
